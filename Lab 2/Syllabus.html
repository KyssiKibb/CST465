            <h2>Grading:</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                The grade calculations will be as follows:
                <br>90% + -> A; 80% + -> B; 70% + -> C; 60% + -> D; Less than 60% -> F

                Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining
                grades under false pretenses. <em>Plagiarism</em> is defined as submitting the language,
                ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of
                plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion. <em>Cheating</em> is defined
                as, but not limited to: obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an
                examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and
                other materials; obtaining or providing unauthorized information concerning all or
                part of an examination prior to that examination; taking an examination for
                another student or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place;
                altering test answers after submittal for grading; changing grades after grades
                have been awarded; or altering other official academic records.
            </p>
            <p>
                All academic dishonesty cases will be reported to the Vice President for Student
                Affairs.
