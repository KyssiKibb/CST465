    <h2>Answer: the app_data folder</h2>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>20: What HTTP 'method' is used when you QuestionType an address into the location bar of your browser and press 'Enter'?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: it is a GET method</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>21: What is the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration at the top of a web page</h2>
    <h2>Answer: in order for the webpage to know how it should display information, it needs to know how to interpret what it's given. the way it interprets HTML5 is different from how it would interpret HTML4 or XHTML. they all have slight differences in their syntax based on things like the intent and the grammar that makes up their language</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>22: What is the difference between inline and block HTML elements</h2>
    <h2>Answer: inline only takes up as much space as it needs. a block will start on a new line and take up as much width as it can.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>23: Explain why the alt attribute of the img tag is important</h2>
    <h2>Answer: this is important for when an image is unable to be loaded. you need to be able to describe to the user what is there so that they can still have a somewhat seamless experience. it's also useful for accessibility reasons. people who are blind and use screen readers rely on the alt attribute to understand what the image is trying to convey.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>24: Explain how a using(){ } block functions and what types of objects it applies to</h2>
    <h2>Answer: a using(){} block creates something that equates to an inline function. it comes with the intent that "the thing i'm doing right here isn't needed for this whole function, just for this specific thing". the merit in having a using(){} block is that it CLEANS UP many different things so that you don't have to worry about it. an example of where this is helpful is in querying a database. using takes care of things like closing up the connection. the types of objects that can be used in a using are those that inherit from IDisposable. this is an interface that requires you to implement a dispose() method for cleaning yourself up.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>25: I often drone on about HTML being a semantic language.  What do I mean, and how does this affect the way HTML should be written</h2>
    <h2>Answer: HTML is a semantic language because it is meant to be human readable. the whole intent is that people can understand what the webpage is doing. an example of this, instead of just using &lt;div&gt; for everything, is to break things up into a &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, etc. this makes it so that the site can be interpreted to do the same thing for the machine, but when a person is reading it they are able to understand the purpose for each of the elements. this changes how HTML should be written because you should treat is as if you're writing an exam. be painfully clear and use all the tools you have to help do that.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>26: A business object can be used as the model as part of the MVC pattern.  Why would we create a model separate from this for use with the view?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: this is to separate business logic from logic required to make the actual site run. a good example of this is when you are trying to do testing on a database. you should create a dummy of it to do testing. if you didn't, you could ruin everything in your database. whenever you want to change something out, it is very important that it's loosely coupled so that you aren't having to 'dig into the weeds' to make any small changes. things like having a stylesheet are a good example of this principle. if you do each of them inline, whenever you want to change the look of something slightly you have to search through EVERYTHING to make sure that it's changed, rather than just having it in one easily updatable location. this is why we did the repository pattern.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>27: Name two benefits of using dependency injection</h2>
    <h2>Answer: dependency injection allows you to have loosely coupled code. this makes maintaining and updating your code much easier. testing is also another very big benefit of using dependency injection. like my answer for the previous question, you would want to have a dummy database whenever you are making changes so that you don't accidentally ruin all of the data that you are trying to preserve. </h2>
    <br>
    <h2>28: HTML Stands For</h2>
    <h2>Answer: HyperText Markup Language</h2>
    <br>

    <h2>Answer: div#specificBox</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>33: Given the following route definition, and assuming the site only contains one controller named HomeController with no attribute routing, which of the following URLs is invalid?&lt;br /&gt;{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{ID?}</h2>

    <h2>Answer: Response Caching</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>40: When a server renders the output of a view and stores this output in memory for faster page serving, this is referred to as _____________ caching.</h2>

    <h2>44: Other than defying convention, renaming the Controllers folder in your project won't lead to any issues.</h2>
    <h2>Answer: false</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>45: ASP.NET uses model-binding to automatically map data passed in to a controller into a model object.  How might this enable form over-posting, and how can we prevent it?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: the reason that this enables form-overposting is because if someone knows about the name of an item in the model that you wish to over post, they can send requests to attack that mapping. in order to prevent it, you explicitly tell the controller method which properties of the model it should be expecting using the Bind attribute</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>46: What is the difference in routing between using app.MapControllers() and app.MapDefaultControllerRoute() in an ASP.NET Core application?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: with app.MapControllers(), no default routing is specified. for the default, you would have to do a app.MapControllerRoute(stuff) call. you have to write out the default paths and how it should map out the page. with app.MapDefaultControllerRoute(), you get the most common functionality.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>47: When jQuery validation is used on the client-side, it is still necessary to check ModelState.IsValid in the controller action</h2>
    <h2>Answer: true</h2>

    <br>
    <h2>53: Special pieces of code that handle the HTTP request/response pipeline in ASP.NET are known as </h2>
    <h2>Answer: middleware</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>54: Does the order in which middleware is registered matter?  Why or Why Not?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: Yes, the order in which middleware is ordered matters. an extreme example of why this is the case is as follows. say you have a middleware that does important checks on your database information, and another one that short circuits the middleware pipeline. if the one performing important database checks is registered after the short circuit middleware, then you will NEVER have the checks on the database, which are theoretically very important.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>55: One great thing about extension methods is that they can access private variables of the classes they extend</h2>
    <h2>Answer: false</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>56: When referemce a model in a view, @model refers to the instance of the object and @Model is used at the top to declare the QuestionType of the instance</h2>

    <h2>Answer: Progam.cs</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>58: In which file do you add middleware to the pipeline in an ASP.NET Core application?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: Program.cs</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>59: How many items on a web page are allowed to have the same value for the ID attribute?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: 0. it has to be unique</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>60: How many items on a web page are allowed to have the same value for the class attribute?</h2>
    <h2>Answer: infinite. as many as you can fit</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>61: With regards to middleware, explain what is meant by short-circuiting the pipeline and how it is achieved</h2>
    <h2>Answer: short circuiting the pipeline is when a middleware prevents any middleware that occurs after it from being able to do anything. this is achieved by not calling await  _next(context). this call is what moves you from the current middleware into the next one, so not calling it is what short-circuits the pipeline</h2>
